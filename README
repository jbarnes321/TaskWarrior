    If you haven't, please create a new project named TaskWarrior. Then go to the solution 
explorer on the right side of Visual Studio. Right-click the project name and select Add.
Then go to the github repository and add all the files. 

    Do this every time you pull new code. But be sure to push your code before you do this 
because it will overwrite all the files in the Visual Studio project. When you do actually 
add the files, it'll ask you if you would like to replac the files. YES!  Then it may ask 
if you would like to reload those files.  YES!  Then you should be good to go.  Add 
whatever you like, just make sure to commit your code, then pull, then commit, then push 
if you ever want to make any additions.  Feel free to edit this README if you find any of 
this information to be inaccurate.
